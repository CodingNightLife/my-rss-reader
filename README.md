My RSS Reader
========
A simple demo Android app showing how to load and display an RSS feed. The app is written for those
new to Android development and thus it avoids using advanced techniques that might be more common in production
 ready apps.

It uses [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [Simple-XML](http://simple.sourceforge.net/)
 to fetch and parse the RSS feed items and it uses Android support library's [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html)
 and [CardView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/CardView.html)
 to display the items in a list.
